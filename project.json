  "what_we_decided": [
    "2026-01-06 - Primary framing: personal research library with knowledge graph, not just study synthesis tool",
    "2026-01-06 - Aggressive deduplication: preprints/postprints and unannotated/annotated treated as version updates",
    "2026-01-06 - Auto-process with flagging for manual review (maximize laziness/seamlessness)",
    "2026-01-06 - Will rely on OCR for scanned PDFs and book scans (including two-page spreads)",
    "2026-01-06 - Use GROBID for slow/comprehensive processing (~30s per paper, worth it for capabilities)",
    "2026-01-06 - Use OCRmyPDF + Unpaper for scanned PDFs and two-page spread handling",
    "2026-01-06 - Citation parsing: extract and store in MVP, defer retrieval to Phase 2",
    "2026-01-06 - MVP metadata: authors, year, title, venue, volume/pages, DOI, abstract, page count",
    "2026-01-06 - Development order: Start with arXiv papers (high quality, no annotations) as v0.1.0 MVP, expand to undergrad papers (mixed quality, annotations) in v0.1.5",
    "2026-01-06 - MVP synthesis: summaries + 'why did I care' context, flashcards deferred, connections fuzzy/deferred",
    "2026-01-06 - Acquisition sources: cast wide net including gray-market (user has legitimate access, just poor quality copies)",
    "2026-01-07 - Use Obsidian as primary output interface - fast generation, excellent search, graph view for connections",
    "2026-01-08 - Two-tier synthesis: quick preview (MVP) + detailed section-by-section summary (on-demand per paper)",
    "2026-01-08 - Link all citations in paper notes, defer author pages to post-MVP",
    "2026-01-08 - Use full author list for citation disambiguation (Smith, Jones & Chen 2023 vs Smith, Lee & Park 2023)",
    "2026-01-08 - Use uv for Python package management instead of pip/venv",
    "2026-01-08 - Target Python 3.14+ (latest features, no backwards compatibility needed)",
    "2026-01-08 - Use real GROBID calls for testing (not mocks) - easier integration debugging"
