Jumbled response to what you've brought up as much as I can remember/identify specific jumping-off points (I don't think those were my assumptions per se? I'm trying to keep my mind open beyond "skills exciting, definitely useful paradigm".)

Utility of custom synthesis style: I would probably default to somewhere between casual and ELI5 for myself *but* a) changing synthesis style is one of the major things it occurs to me that a user might want to do, b) I might want to alter it by field (I'm a lot more comfortable with dense technical jargon in critical theory than in STEM despite having history/proficiency across both--which means I'm also aware that's not the most common order for that preference to be in), c) more formal style is immediately drop-in useful for "synthesize this for literature review purposes"--there's a desirable known use case where the approachable "you know, that thing where" style I want to capture talking to myself becomes a liability, that I want to support.

I'm interested in your breakdown of how to divide skill capacities as the party here who understands the most about skills, including for future features. Remember the eventual goal/original picture for this project--before realizing that the knowledge-management aspect was the foundation to make it work--was synthesis across multiple mediums for ongoing coursework: transcripts of lectures, personal notes, presentations, class readings, the citation-graph related readings. 

Looking at documentation for the agent skills standard, one of the things that catches my eye is the recommendation to structure multi-step tasks with checkboxes that the agent can copy and go through--are there points where it makes the most sense to think of it that way/where are those points? I'm thinking e.g. that could be immediately useful for the structured summary feature, and for identifying other features about a text (key terms/keywords/technical term extraction?).

I can't tell if it's the wrong level of abstraction to think in terms of "understand material" as a core skill ("here is the shape of how to think about input") that gets used in relation to different outputs ("quick summary", "detailed summary",  "interactive synthesis", "keyword/technical term glossary extraction", "cross-source synthesis") in different registers ("explain to an enthusiastic listener outside the field", "explain to an undergrad with domain knowledge and a hangover", "use classroom-appropriate formal language"). 

I *do* think that rapid iteration is going to be *bursty*--the prompts that work for processing arXiv papers about LLMs will hopefully generalize to my sociolinguistics backlog, but what about when I start uploading critical theory and religious studies from undergrad? What about processing nontraditional paper formats in the humanities? What happens when suddenly inputs include lecture recording transcripts or a Whisper transcript of my notes to myself? There's enough branching use cases that even aside from the token cacheing aspect, the idea of hardcoding prompts in Python when there's an alternative, forever, sounds miserable.

(I'm trying to infodump and possibly coming off as confrontational, to be clear I think we're on the same page and I remain particularly interested in what you have to say as, by definition, the expert skill-user in the conversation.) 

I feel like at the point where skills become worth writing at all they require loading with dependencies, is one of the concrete things I'm arriving to; a zero-dependencies skill and a well-thought-out prompt feel like functionally the same thing, the value proposition *is* in the ability  to make "think about a thing" as modular as code is. So from my perspective it seems most natural to design monolithic prompts as skills-to-be but introduce skills from the ground up when they're relevant with dependencies as opposed to that being an addition. I think this amounts to me saying "skills come in with skill composition"?

Value proposition for skills in my understanding includes: More ability to record use cases across domains--it's easy for us to prototype for the LLM-related research and probably not much harder for comp ling in general, but the "not just clear my open tabs *now* but remember what I went to school *for*" value proposition starts including history of philosophy (my actual major), sociolinguistics (my research focus as a linguist thus far), neuroscience (media research where audience response on the brain level was relevant), history, library sciences, etc.--and that's just me, not the potential to be robust against other users that I'd like to be well-rounded enough to accommodate. It sounds like the skill structure opens up more breathing room to be able to signpost ways to interact with texts that aren't relative easy mode fields-wise.

Another major use case for skills: breaking down text that's too large for the context window? that's something we're partially trying to do on the text-processing side but having that as a feature of gracefully handling paper sections comes to mind.

Other toggles that do matter: language support--I need translations for anything other than English and Spanish but do some high-level study in Spanish, someone else would get burned by my assumption that Spanish glosses are never needed. User languages should be a setting/parameter somewhere in the chain.

I like what you're proposing and it's helping me think more concretely about usage patterns! I just end up wanting to chew on it like a large dog and feel like I should emphasize that this is mostly wandering yes-anding to your response, I want to keep building on this + understanding skills in your context.

Thoughts on skills as future-proofing against the eventual "full-stack" use case of "actually involve class material including lectures etc."? (Skill for parsing syllabi or other metadata documentation to extract tags, possible relations, named sources, key terms that might be familiar springs to mind in terms of "what becomes possible if we have a framework for 'define arbitrary structured ingestion' that's not a delicate sheaf of bespoke prompts"?)

Would using the skills API allow the chat-with-paper functionality to cache the paper at all? or to cache an intermediate explanation of the paper (I'm seeing best practices recommending interstitial json files for interacting with complex forms or other multi-step processes where it's cruel and unusual to keep the whole context at the front of your mind at once and want to know how that translates), or something?
